## Python

I am trying to learn coding so for that we need a language like python js c etc there are many as a beginner i am going with python for because it is the easy one as told by many 😁.

My plan is to start with python and as the journey goes learn about go lang and more about back-end development . like typing i am going to take notes for python also on a daily bases so i will link both python and typing to daily-notes

### Steps

1. Just find some sites or books to learn about python basics and syntax used for python
2. Escape toutoral hell . From the experence i can say that it sucks 🫩
3. just like typing practice python daily and do real world projects to get better
